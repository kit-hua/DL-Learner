RRHC is an algorithm for concept learning in description logics.

It is based on the CELOE algorithm regarding:
* heuristic
* refinement operator

It implements a so-called "rapid restart hill climbing" strategy for selecting tree node for expansion. 
The current implementation is still prototypical in sense that it has much duplicated code from CELOE.
All code can be found in the package `dl-learner/components-core/src/main/java/org/dllearner/algorithms/rrch`.

For running the algorithm, make a config file similar to the examples from DL-Learner with following changes:

* h.type = "celoe_heuristic_lw"
* h.expansionPenaltyFactor = 0.02
* h.nodeRefinementPenalty = 0
* h.startNodeBonus = 0
* h.gainBonusFactor = 0.2

* alg.type = "rrhc"
* alg.heStep = 0
* alg.heCorrection = false

For a better comparison with CELOE, apply following changes to any original DL-Learner config:

* h.type = "celoe_heuristic"
* alg.type = "celoe_ori"
* alg.heStep = 0
* alg.heCorrection = false
